# C++

## What is C++
C++ is an object oriented programming language that originated from C. Similar to C, C++ Bjarne Stroustrup the Danish Computer scientist who created C++ wanted to make an improvement to the original C. These improvements added inheritance, and classes. This made C++ and object oriented programming language which is a language that is characterized by classes and objects linked by the functions.

**Why use it?**
C++ is a very popular common language that is taught in school and used in very popular industries. One very reason is that most game industries will create their own game engine using C++ since how efficient the language is. One popular game using this will be mincraft of course this is the Windows edition and not the old game which was made in java.Some jobs that can be chosen that may use C++ from this as well a brief description of each.

* Software developer-  Will create and sale their own software
* Junior Programmer- You can debug, create and review code as an entry level that open up to other positions.
* Gamer Programmer - You can either work at a company or your own to create games, game engines.


**C++ Example Code**

The following code has a class called person which then has variables such as name and age. Within the class there is one function made public called birthday. In the main the class is called and an object is created called Male for example. Now the function can be called by the object male and male can send its own values inside the function which is called passing. The function can then also send back the new values. An example can be male having an age set to 30 then when it is passed inside the function it will return the new value being 31 with the int value age being incremented by 1.
``` cpp
/
Class person
{

char name[20];
int age;
 
Public:
  void birthday(){
  }
};
int main()
{
Person Male;

}

```
