## Javascript History 



Javascript is an object oriented scripting language that is currently used to make online sites more interactive. It was created in the late 90s and it was used along with html and CSS. Javascript has become successful over the years due to the fact it is simple to learn along with letting programmers be able to create applications out of it. Currently javascript has many libraries to choose from with the  most popular being vue and react which allow many teams to be able to successfully launch more in depth apps. It first started off as a client based meaning your computer will load up all on the PC. Javascript also can also be server sided meaning a database is the one communicating, which can be able to manipulate other files on that server. Currently javascript is the leading client side language for scripting and can be used for plenty of things. This is one of the reasons why our group decided to implement the use of javascript for the AWS server. The end goal will be to have our site be fully autonomous by hosting a functional page containing all the html,css and javascript code, which will be an in browser game.

**Examples**

- Adding animation to the site to be more visually appealing.
- Being able to play games on the page, along with creating games for sites
- Creating pop up advertisement
- Javascript is also used to create web servers and applications
