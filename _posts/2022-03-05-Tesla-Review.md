## Tesla model 3

After purchasing a Tesla model 3 for the first time recently I want to go over the process of how it went along with how the car functions. Since this is my first ever electric vehicle I do expect to have some trendmous gas savings over the course of ownership. As well as not having any major service checks such as oil/transmission check ups. I will cover how purchasing this vehicle was along with some of the tech in the car.

**Purchasing process**

The process was very simple as ordering online. The tesla website lets you customize the car you would like to purchase then simply place the deposit order fee which at the moment is 250 to reserve the car. Due to the long back order it will take a few months most likely depending on the model to arrive but the pick up process was just as simple. After picking up the car all the document signatures were done via the app to save time and no stress to talk to any sales reps like at a normal dealer.

**Tesla Tech review**

Since Tesla is known to have extremely modernized software it kind of mimics the technology of an apple device due to its simplistic layout. The car can be synced up over the smartphone where you can control the AC, volume, charging times, as well as set up any services for the car if needed. Sadly though tesla is notorious for some dodgy quality control and I had already had to use the tesla service via which was extremely simple to do. The car has a minor air leak which is possibly due to the windows not properly sealed on the front right passenger side. The service appointment was made in just about a minute and was able to configure the exact issue on the app. Moving on to the tablet inside the car which is practically an ipad, this accounts to the dash in this car. This tablet will show everything needed to drive speed, navigation, AC, media controls along with adjusting mirrors and steering wheel placement. Since I am tech savvy all these features in the car make it even more valuable to me as most modern cars just offer simple apple car play which does not allow the use of media devices like netflix and youtube to be played like the tesla offers. I do hope for more improvements to be added in later software updates as well as a bigger collection of their video game catalog that can be played while parked or charging the car on a road trip. This car is rated to be one of the safest cars as it has 12 sensors for 360 viewing. The car can be able to avoid, brake as well as drive on roads/highways like no modern legacy dealer has done.  I did not however purchase the full self driving and the auto lane assist on the highway is more than enough for me at the moment which comes in handy for ease of driving. Teslaâ€™s team is working hard to have full self driving be fully implemented as they have created an advanced chip capable of having AI to learn while the car is driving to further improve its skills. 

**Final thoughts**
I currently recommend purchasing a Tesla in the near future once supply increases when the new factory in texas is fully operational this year.
