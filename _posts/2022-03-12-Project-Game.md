## Project Game


We have decided as a group to make a game for our project for the application requirement. This game is a knock off of space invaders which will be done using html, css and javascript. The majority of the code will be done in javascript as this is the part that will hold all the game mechanics. CSS will be used for level design to ensure the game playfield is even out and centered correctly. HTML will have very barebones code as this is where both the style.css and main.js files will be linked so it is called when the site is loaded. 

**Game idea and premise**

Currently the game is in early development and I have only completed most of the CSS part to ensure the level is centered along with having a border set for the game to be played in. The background was chosen from a royalty free asset website from kenney.nl. This site can be used to download royalty free assets such as backgrounds, powerups, enemies, characters along with sound. Currently the level is set up when the page is loaded there is an animation where it is set in a moving space environment. This is done by having the keyframes to have the background position set from 0 px all the way to 256 px which is the max for this specific PNG. Some concepts that should be done in the following presentation is having the player set and be able to move left and right on the screen. There will also be a border to limit both player and enemies to not be able to leave the play field. Shooting mechanics will be added as well where both enemy and player can shoot and be destroyed if hit by the laser. A victory condition will be set once all enemy ships have been destroyed. All of these mechanics will be done in javascript and lastly for some added bonus in game sound will be added which will be downloaded kenney.nl
